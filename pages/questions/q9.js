  {"Question: Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology you've not worked with before. How would you go about troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better? <br/> <br/> Answer: First, I would search for similar situations with the information the customer provided initially so I could show up to an in person conversation or initial response with some basic understanding of what they're working against. If I couldn't find anything to help, I might watch a tutorial video or training to get a very basic grasp of terminologies they might use. <br/> After some newbie groundwork I might approach a conversation with the customer to make sure I am fully understanding what they're stuck on. Can you walk me through it? Do I need to know everything, or just where you're stuck? <br/> - support understanding what the problem actually is can be tough, and commuication up to that point is really important to the customer. There's no shame in saying \"I dont know\" as long as you follow it with a plan to know soon. <br/> Next, I would focus on trying to bring their problem into a test environment. Is there any way I can get the problem into my computer so I can work on this without the customer present? Hopefully that is possible, and from there I will have the internet and fellow engineers to lean on for dissection. ".split("<br/>").join("\n")}
