  {"Question: What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term? <br/> <br/> Answer: My guess for most common problem relating to Vercel services would be help with web crawlers, whitelisting cloud resources, or adding users with various levels of controls to the platform. I'd help with common items like this by writing knowledge base artcicles or otherwise customer facing documentation which could be easily found or pointed to by the pages they'd likely form these questions looking at.
